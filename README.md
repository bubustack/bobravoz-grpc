`bobravoz-grpc` is a specialized, high-performance transport operator for [bobrapet](https://github.com/bubustack/bobrapet), designed to enable real-time, streaming AI and data workflows on Kubernetes. It acts as an intelligent transport hub, dynamically configuring gRPC connections and performing in-flight data processing for `bobrapet`'s `streaming` stories.

## üåü Key features

- **Intelligent Transport Topologies**: Automatically analyzes `Story` definitions to configure the optimal connection pattern:
  - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: For maximum throughput, engrams are connected directly when no intermediate processing is required.
  - **Hub-and-Spoke**: For complex workflows, data is routed through the operator's hub to execute `Story` primitives in-flight.
- **Active Data Processing Hub**: `bobravoz-grpc` is more than a configurator; it's an active data plane component. It runs its own gRPC server to handle live data streams, executing CEL-based transformations and other logic without adding latency.
- **Pluggable by Design**: Built on a flexible `Transport` interface, the operator is architected to support other real-time protocols like NATS or Kafka in the future.
- **Seamless `bobrapet` Integration**: Natively understands `bobrapet` concepts like `streaming` patterns and `PerStory` vs. `PerStoryRun` strategies to ensure correct and efficient transport configuration.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Simply add an annotation to your `bobrapet` `Story` to have `bobravoz-grpc` manage its transport.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

`bobravoz-grpc` operates on both the Kubernetes control plane and the data plane to provide its functionality.

- **Control Plane**: The `TransportReconciler` watches for `StoryRun` resources. When it finds one belonging to a `streaming` `Story` configured for `grpc` transport, it analyzes the step graph and injects the correct `UPSTREAM_HOST` and `DOWNSTREAM_HOST` environment variables into the engram containers.

- **Data Plane**: The operator runs an embedded gRPC `Hub Server`. When a `Story` requires in-flight processing (e.g., a `transform` step), the reconciler configures the engrams to route their data through this hub, which then executes the primitive's logic.

### üß≠ Connection topologies

Depending on your `Story` definition, `bobravoz-grpc` will create one of two connection types:

1.  **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Simple, direct connection for maximum performance.
    *Story Definition:*
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: step-a
        ref: { name: engram-a }
      - name: step-b
        ref: { name: engram-b }
    ```
    *Resulting Topology:*
    `Engram A <--- gRPC ---> Engram B`

2.  **Hub-and-Spoke**: Data is routed through the operator for processing.
    *Story Definition:*
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: step-a
        ref: { name: engram-a }
      - name: transform-data
        type: transform
        with:
          expr: '{ "new_payload": payload.old_field + "!" }'
      - name: step-b
        ref: { name: engram-b }
    ```
    *Resulting Topology:*
    `Engram A --- gRPC --> bobravoz-hub --- gRPC --> Engram B`

## üöÄ Quick start

Using `bobravoz-grpc` requires an existing `bobrapet` installation.

### 1. Install the Operator

First, install the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):
```bash
make install
```

Next, deploy the operator controller to your cluster:
```bash
make deploy IMG=<your-repo>/bobravoz-grpc:latest
```
*(Replace `<your-repo>` with your container registry)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bubustack/bobravoz-grpc.git
    cd bobravoz-grpc
    ```

2.  **Run the controller locally:**
    This command runs the operator on your machine, using your local `kubeconfig` to communicate with the cluster. This is great for rapid development and debugging.
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

3.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

4.  **End-to-end tests (Kind optional):**
    ```bash
    make test-e2e
    ```
